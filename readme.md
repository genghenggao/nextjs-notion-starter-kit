# Henggao's HomePage

![](img/HomePage.png)

This is my portfolio site (see [here](https://blog.genghenggao.top)). It is using the following starter:

https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit


It's actually deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) at no cost.

## Tools used?

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is used as the backend. I was already a huge fan of the system, and now I have just a new set of pages that are used for this website.
- [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) is used to render Notion content in a React framework
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is the React framework used to orchestrate the content

Sincere thanks!
